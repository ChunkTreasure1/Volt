# Volt
Volt is a game engine originally made by students at The Game Assembly as a part of the second year corriculum.
The Game engine is now in continued development as a passion project by some of the students.

To access the engine, you first have to run the setup file. It is located in "Volt/Volt/scripts/Setup.bat".
Running the setup will require you to have python installed. On windows, this can be done using the microsoft store.

You might get this error "Error: cannot open Volt-ScriptCore: no such file or directory"

If you do, simply run the setup file again.

Then you are good to go starting the sln file of volt.
